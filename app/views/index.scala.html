  Here lies the 151 Challenge main page.

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/record">Record Progress</a></li>
    <li><a href="/displayEntries">Display/edit your recorded progress</a></li>
    <li><a href="/leaderboard">View Leaderboard</a></li>
  </ul>


  <p>The rules are as follows:</p>
  <p>
    In any order, interleaving as you will, do:
    <ul>
      <li>3051 Situps</li>
      <li>2051 Lunges</li>
      <li>1051 Burpees</li>
      <li>151 Miles</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then when all that is done, drink a shot of Bacardi 151 and take a picture to mark the occasion.

    You can join the <a href="https://groupme.com/join_group/11720972/BwiYla">Group Me</a> chat for all the contestants
    to ask questions, stay up to date and talk trash. If you've already joined, you can <a href="https://app.groupme.com/chats">go there now.</a>

    Conversion ratios:
    You can get conversion ratios for things if you can't physically do them for some reason. We'll be kind in that regard. However
    if you can do it, but want some conversion because you're doing a lot of something else, don't expect friendly responses.
    Part of the challenge is suffering through whatever it is we're doing together.

    Some ratios we've agreed to:
    <ul>
      <li>Biking Miles 10:1 Run/Walk Mile</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The spirit of this is to incentivizing more exercise. So if you have a pedometer, think about tracking only what
    is really walking or running, and not your day-to-day walking in the office that everyone does but not many track.
