@main("Rules of the Challenge") {
  <p>For 2016, the rules are as follows:</p>
  <p>
    In any order, interleaving as you will, do:
    <ul>
      <li>3051 Air Squats</li>
      <li>2051 Push Ups</li>
      <li>1051 10-second Planks (any position)</li>
      <li>151 Miles</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Then when all that is done, drink a shot of Bacardi 151 and take a picture to mark the occasion.
    We start on on @OneFiveOneDateUtils.printableDate(OneFiveOneConstants.START_OF_CHALLENGE) at 12:00am.
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>
    Conversion ratios:
    You can get conversion ratios for things if you can't physically do them for some reason. We'll be kind in that regard. However
    if you can do it, but want some conversion because you're doing a lot of something else, don't expect friendly ratios.
    Part of the challenge is suffering through whatever it is we're doing together.

    Some ratios we've agreed to:
  <ul>
    <li>10 Biking Miles:1 Run/Walk Mile</li>
    <li>Outdoor Soccer game:2 Run/Walk Miles</li>
    <li>Ultimate Frisbee game:2 Run/Walk Miles</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
    If you do squats with a weight, or harder push ups, etc, you can of course count those as a
    rep for the base exercise. You don't get a bonus, but you can count it as a rep.
  </p>
  <p>
    The spirit of this is to incentivize more exercise. So if you have a pedometer, think about tracking only what
    is really extra walking or running, and not your day-to-day walking in the office or home that everyone does but will not track
    without a pedometer.
